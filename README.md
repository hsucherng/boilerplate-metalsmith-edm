# Metalsmith EDM boilerplate

This is a [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io) EDM boilerplate that has been setup to provide a modern workflow for EDM tasks. Using this workflow, we will no longer have to set styles directly inline, and we get to leverage some of the key utilities that have already been setup in the regular Metalsmith boilerplate.

This boilerplate has been setup with the following:

- [Express](https://github.com/chiefy/metalsmith-express) (which also comes with LiveReload)
- [Inline CSS](https://github.com/borisovg/metalsmith-inline-css)
- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

## Initial setup

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Currently tested with NodeJS v6.9.3.
2. Clone this repository onto your machine.
3. Make a copy of this folder and paste it at where you want your development files to be.
4. Open up the CLI (command-line interface, e.g. cmd.exe) and `cd` into the fresh copy of the boilerplate folder.
5. Run `yarn`. This should install all the required dependencies.
6. Delete the `.git` folder that was cloned together with the boilerplate, then initialise the folder as a new Git repository.
7. You are now ready to start building.

Remember to change the `EDM Name` in the `<title>` tag within the `index.html` file, as well as at the top of `style.scss`.

## Build flow

To start the build, open up your CLI and `cd` into the folder. Then type `node build` and press enter to start the process, which does the following:

1. Deletes the existing `build` folder.
2. Starts up Metalsmith, which will compile all the necessary files into a *new* `build` folder.
3. Once the compilation is complete, the files are served up on localhost - it is `http://localhost:8080/edm/` by default.

## Configurations

Check the files in the `configs` folder for the configurations that affect the build and its output.

### Virtual Folder

The build has a "virtual folder" setup by default â€” basically, the build sends all the output files into the `virtualFolder` path that is set inside `configs/misc.js`. This is to allow for a more organised browser history.

So, for example, if you are developing a website called *The Jackson Five's*, you should change the value of the `virtualFolder` from `'edm\\'` to `'the-jackson-fives\\'`. After that, your files will be served under `http://localhost:8080/the-jackson-fives/`, and will be distinct in your browser history.

To disable this, set the `virtualFolder` value to `''`.

## Debugging notes

For certain plugins, we can get the build to log information in the console by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable. Currently, in this build, it seems that `metalsmith-in-place` and `metalsmith-copy` have been setup for this behaviour.

On Windows, use the `set` command to set a value for the `DEBUG` environment variable. Setting it to `*` would turn on debugging for all configured plugins:

    set DEBUG=*

To turn on debugging for only one plugin, set its name as the value:

    set DEBUG=metalsmith-in-place

To turn off debugging, set the value to nothing:

    set DEBUG=
