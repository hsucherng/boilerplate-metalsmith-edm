# EDM Name

This project uses [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io), and has been setup with the following:

- [Express](https://github.com/chiefy/metalsmith-express) (which also comes with LiveReload)
- [Inline CSS](https://github.com/borisovg/metalsmith-inline-css)
- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

## Initial setup

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Currently tested with NodeJS v6.9.3 and Yarn v1.6.0.
2. Clone this repository onto your machine.
3. Open up the command-line and `cd` into this repository folder.
4. Run `yarn`. This should install all the required dependencies.
5. You are now ready to start building. Run `node build --open`, and the website will be opened in your browser once it is ready.

## Configurations

Check the files in the `configs` folder for the configurations that affect the build and its output.

### Virtual Folder

The build has a "virtual folder" setup by default â€” basically, the build sends all the output files into the `virtualFolder` path that is set inside `configs/misc.js`. This is to allow for a more organised browser history.

So, for example, if you are developing a website called *The Jackson Five's*, you should change the value of the `virtualFolder` from `'edm'` to `'the-jackson-fives'`. After that, your files will be served under `http://localhost:8080/the-jackson-fives/`, and will be distinct in your browser history.

To disable this, set the `virtualFolder` value to `''`.

## Debugging notes

For certain plugins, we can get the build to log information in the console by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable. Currently, in this build, it seems that `metalsmith-in-place` and `metalsmith-copy` have been setup for this behaviour.

On Windows, use the `set` command to set a value for the `DEBUG` environment variable. Setting it to `*` would turn on debugging for all configured plugins:

    set DEBUG=*

To turn on debugging for only one plugin, set its name as the value:

    set DEBUG=metalsmith-in-place

To turn off debugging, set the value to nothing:

    set DEBUG=
